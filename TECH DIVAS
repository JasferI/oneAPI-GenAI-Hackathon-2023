problem statement : Multi model mental health assessment

The proposed solution integrates NLP, CV, and voice recognition to create a comprehensive mental health assessment system using Intel oneAPI. 
Analyzing interviews, written responses, facial expressions, body language, and voice inputs, it provides insights into cognitive patterns and emotions. Additionally, a predefined avatar enhances user engagement, enriching the interface with basic blinking and lip movement. 
This Intel oneAPI interactive platform facilitates precise diagnostics and personalized treatment planning for mental health professionals, while also providing valuable support and guidance for users.
